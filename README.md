\#  Clinic Management System



A fully functional Windows Forms application built with C# and SQL Server to manage clinic operations including patient records, visits, doctors, and activity logs.



This project demonstrates database handling, UI management, state control, and structured application architecture in a real-world scenario.



---



\##  System Overview



The system allows clinic administrators to:



\- Register and manage patients

\- Drop and restore patients

\- Record and manage patient visits

\- Track doctors

\- Monitor real-time dashboard statistics

\- Log system activity

\- Manage secure admin login



---



\##  Technical Highlights



\- 🔹 Custom form loading system with form caching

\- 🔹 Dashboard counters auto-update

\- 🔹 Soft-delete system (Drop/Restore patients)

\- 🔹 Activity logging implementation

\- 🔹 Reusable UserControls

\- 🔹 SQL Server database integration

\- 🔹 Connection handling via `DBaccess` class

\- 🔹 Session management using `UserSession`

\##  Architecture Approach



\- Separation of concerns (UI, DB access, session management)

\- Reusable components (UserControls)

\- Encapsulated database operations

\- Centralized dashboard logic

\- Controlled state transitions (Drop/Restore patients)



---



\##  Key Components



\- `PatientsForm` – Patient operations

\- `PatientVisitControl` – Visit recording

\- `DoctorsForm` – Doctor management

\- `Dashboard` – System statistics

\- `DBaccess` – All database operations

\- `UserSession` – User tracking

\- `ActivityForm` – Logs system activity



---



\##  Drop \& Restore Logic



Instead of permanently deleting patients, the system:

\- Moves dropped patients to a `DroppedPatients` table

\- Allows restoration with integrity checks

\- Prevents duplicate patient keys

\- Prompts the user before restoring



This demonstrates data integrity awareness and real-world system design.
